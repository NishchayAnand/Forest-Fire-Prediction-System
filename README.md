# Introduction
Developed a machine learning algorithm that leverages four meteorological observations (temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed) to make precise predictions of the Fire Weather Index. This index exhibits a strong correlation with forest fire occurrences, enabling us to generate early warnings of potential forest fires.

Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network), SVR (Support Vector Regression), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to identify the most suitable predictive model that would yield accurate forecasts.
